Eclipse MOSAIC is a well-established and generic simulation tool, enables the coupling of different simulators for a realistic representation of vehicular traffic, emissions, wireless communication (Cellular/Ad-hoc), user behavior, and the modelling of smart mobility applications.

Eclipse MOSAIC is based on the High Level Architecture (HLA) and uses common concepts defined in IEEE-Standard or Modeling and Simulation (M&S). Due to the high flexibility and co-simulation of different subsystems, Eclipse MOSAIC enables the simulation, analysis and evaluation of the various aspects of future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) as well as the E-Mobility concepts.

Besides the possibility to couple external simulators, Eclipse MOSAIC also offers built-in simulators for different simulation levels to realize detailed V2X communication scenarios quickly and easily.
