Eclipse MOSAIC is based on the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard for simulation interoperability and provides a
runtime infrastructure (RTI) as a standalone master that centrally regulates communication, time synchronization and
data exchange.
<!--, compared to other existing standards such as the Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI), which does not provide a
master algorithm. So you can only focus on the coupling process of your preferred simulator.-->
