The basic idea of combining different simulation tools in a single environment shows the open source nature of Eclipse MOSAIC. Our team lives and breathes open source and for this reason we rely on the collective knowledge of our community to further develop the Eclipse MOSAIC project through new impulses. You are invited to support us in realizing our vision of a generally accepted open source simulation environment for Intelligent Transport Systems.
