This online Documentation provides detailed information for the current release of **Eclipse MOSAIC**. It is accompanied with our **[Tutorials]({{< ref "/tutorials" >}})**. Generally, it is recommended to read the Documentation first, especially the Sections on *How To Get Started* and the *Simulator Overview*. For external simulators like Eclipse SUMO, OMNeT++ / INET or ns-3, the according project websites contain more exhaustive information, of course.

{{% alert note %}}
Our **[Tutorials]({{< ref "/tutorials" >}})** are intended for step-by-step practical learning. It should be possible to start them right away without prior experience with Eclipse MOSAIC. However, for several aspects, the **[Documentation]({{< ref "/docs" >}})** should be consulted at least in parallel.
