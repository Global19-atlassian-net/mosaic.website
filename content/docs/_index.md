This online documentation provides detailed information for the latest release of Eclipse MOSAIC. Some details may
deviate, however, as we constantly keep this documentation in sync with the current main branch of our
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosaic" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub repository</a>.

This documentation is accompanied by our **[tutorials]({{< ref "/tutorials" >}})**. Generally, it is recommended to read
the documentation first, especially the sections on [How To Get Started]({{< ref "/docs/getting_started" >}}) and
[Simulator Overview]({{< ref "/docs/simulators" >}}). For external simulators like Eclipse SUMO, OMNeT++ / INET or ns-3,
the according project websites contain more exhaustive information, of course.

{{% alert note %}}
Our **[tutorials]({{< ref "/tutorials" >}})** are intended for step-by-step practical learning. It should be possible to
start them right away without prior experience with Eclipse MOSAIC. However, for several aspects, the should be
consulted at least in parallel.
